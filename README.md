## Usage

### Playing the Game:

1. Launch the app on your device.

2. The game board will be displayed with empty squares.
3. Players take turns tapping on the squares to place their mark (X or O).
4. The app keeps track of whose turn it is and displays it on the screen.
5. Once a square is filled, it cannot be selected again.
6. The game checks for winning conditions after each turn.
7. If a player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), the game announces the winner.
8. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game announces a draw.

### Tracking Wins & Draws:

- The app keeps track of the total wins and draws for each player throughout the gameplay sessions.
- You can access these statistics through a dedicated screen within the app.

### Resetting the Game:

- A reset button is usually provided within the app to allow you to start a new game with a fresh board.
